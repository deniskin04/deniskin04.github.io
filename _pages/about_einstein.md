My name is Viacheslav "Slava" Deniskin, and I'm a PhD Candidate in Marketing at the University of Kansas, specializing in Consumer Behavior. Welcome to my website! Here you can find my CV, resume, and other relevant professional documents. You can also explore and learn more about me, my current projects, and my other interests.

If you have any questions, or just want to start a chat, use the [contact tab](/deniskin04/contact) to reach out.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
